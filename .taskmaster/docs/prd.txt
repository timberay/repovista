Docker Registry Web UI Service - Product Requirements Document

PROJECT OVERVIEW
RepoVista is a web-based user interface for Docker Registry that enables developers to easily browse, search, and select Docker images for deployment. The service provides an intuitive alternative to CLI-based registry management tools.

BUSINESS OBJECTIVES
- Provide developers with an efficient web interface to select Docker images for deployment
- Improve the efficiency of image selection process
- Deliver an intuitive and simple image browsing experience
- Simplify the Docker image deployment workflow

TARGET USERS
- Primary: Developers who need to select and verify deployment images
- Secondary: DevOps engineers monitoring image status
- Tertiary: Team leads tracking team's image usage

KEY FEATURES

Feature: Repository Listing
- Display all repositories from Docker Registry
- Real-time search by repository name
- Sort repositories by name and last update time (ascending/descending)
- Pagination support (20/50/100 items per page)
- Show tag count for each repository
- Grid layout with repository cards

Feature: Repository Details
- Display all tags for selected repository
- Show tag metadata: name, digest ID, image size, creation date
- Search tags by name
- Sort tags by name, creation date, or size
- Accordion-style expansion for tag details
- Generate and display pull commands

Feature: Image Management
- Generate Docker pull commands for selected images
- Copy pull commands to clipboard with one click
- Display detailed image information in accordion format
- Read-only access to Docker Registry (no delete operations)

Backend Architecture:
- Python FastAPI framework
- Docker Registry v2 API integration
- Read-only registry access with authentication
- RESTful API design
- CORS configuration for frontend communication
- Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Response caching for performance

Frontend Architecture:
- Pure JavaScript (ES6+) without frameworks
- HTML5 and CSS3
- Fetch API for HTTP communication
- Single-page application design
- Event delegation for dynamic content
- Responsive grid layout for repository cards
- Accordion UI pattern for expandable details

Deployment:
- Docker containerization for both frontend and backend
- Docker Compose for orchestration
- Production-ready configuration
- Auto-start on container launch
- Environment-based configuration

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
- Chrome browser support (desktop)
- Light theme UI design
- Loading states for all async operations
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
