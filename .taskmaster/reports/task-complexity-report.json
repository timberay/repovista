			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Set up project structure and development environment",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the initial project setup into subtasks for creating directory structure, Python environment setup, dependency management, configuration templates, and version control initialization",
			"reasoning": "Basic setup task with clear sequential steps. Low complexity as it involves standard project initialization procedures without complex logic or integrations"

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Docker Registry v2 API client",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for client class structure, authentication implementation, API endpoint methods, error handling, retry logic, response parsing, caching strategy, and comprehensive testing",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to external API integration, authentication handling, error scenarios, and need for robust retry mechanisms. Requires understanding of Docker Registry v2 API specifications"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Create repository listing API endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for endpoint setup, query parameter handling, pagination logic, search implementation, sorting functionality, caching layer, and API documentation",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity with multiple features (pagination, search, sorting) that need proper implementation and testing. Requires coordination with registry client"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create tag listing API endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for endpoint creation, tag metadata retrieval, pull command generation, repository name handling, search/sort features, response formatting, and error handling",
			"reasoning": "Similar to repository listing but adds complexity with pull command generation and special handling for repository names with slashes. Requires careful data transformation"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Set up CORS and API configuration",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into CORS middleware setup, environment variable configuration, API documentation setup, health check implementation, and logging configuration",
